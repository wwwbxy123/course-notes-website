## Milestone 1

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class. You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)

[Briefly explain who the intended target audience(s) is(are) for your website.]

### Feel and Features (Milestone 1)

[Briefly describe the feel and features your site will have to cater to those audiences.]

### Final Content (Milestone 1)

[Briefly describe the content you plan to include in the final submission, and why it's the right content for those audiences.]


## Milestone 2

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Target Audience (Milestone 2)

[A clearer description of audience: who are they, what are they interested in with respect to this site, and what are the design goals for that audience.]

### Site Theme (Milestone 2)

[A description of your overall site theme and why it's appropriate for the audience.]

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

[A description of how you generated and considered alternatives for the site's navigation.]

### Organization (Milestone 2)

[An explanation of how you came to the organization and content that you chose.]


## Milestone 3

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Changes from Milestone 2 (Milestone 3)

[What changes did you make from Milestone 2 to content/information/navigation, and why?]

### Visual Design (Milestone 3)

[Discuss your visual designs: how did you come to them, what are their strengths and weaknesses, how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?]

### Emotion (Milestone 3)

[Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions where you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?]


## Final Submission - Rationale

This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section run several paragraphs (1-3). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during user testing and how you addressed them. Quotes from your users during testing are also very powerful when explaining your rationale.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier rationales.

### Changes from Milestone 3 (Final Submission)

- Changes since Milestone 3 and why, particularly ones you learned from testing.

### Audience (Final Submission)

[A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.]

### Design Goals (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final organization met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).]
